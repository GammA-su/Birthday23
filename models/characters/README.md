character.tscn inherits the poses from `nanahira/nanahira_papercraft.glb`, so that one needs to be updated to update animations

The characters.blend file contains all the poses and animation export settings when exporting as glTF. Just select the character to export + the armature, then export/override the corresponding character .glb file.
